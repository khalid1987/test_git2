I am Khalid

I remember when everything was perfect and peaceful. It was a year or two ago, I don’t remember when exactly—I was maybe four and a half. No one knows what went wrong. It started when the power went out for days. Everything was dark and the sun went away earlier than usual. There wasn’t any information getting through to any of us. We didn’t know what was going on.
